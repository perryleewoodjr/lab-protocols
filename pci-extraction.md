### Safety
- Use extreme caution when working with phenol which can quickly cause severe burns&mdash;possibly even without any sensation of pain. Wear a lab coat and two pairs of nitrile gloves and remove immediately if phenol is believed to have made contact with them.
- Perform the isolation steps involving phenol and chloroform within a fume hood.

### Disposal
All phenol and chloroform contaminated waste must put into hazardous waste.

### Procedure
#### 1) Phase Separating Tube
1. Prepare one phase separating tube per sample by dispensing 0.1-0.2 mL of silicone grease from a 60 mL syringe into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.

#### 2) Lysis
1. Prepare lysis master mix containing 5 &micro;L of 20 mg/mL proteinase K per 300 &micro;L proteinase K buffer solution
2. Add 300 &micro;L of lysis master mix to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing up to 20 mg of sample tissue (approximately the size of a grain of rice)
3. Incubate samples at 55 &deg;C in shaker incubator set to 500 for 8 hours

#### 3) Isolation
1. Centrifuge phase separating tubes at 16,100 RCF for 1 minute
2. Add 300 &micro;L of lysis product to phase separating tube
3. Add 500 &micro;L of Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol to phase separating tube
4. Mix samples by inverting tubes and shaking for 1 minute
5. Centrifuge at 16,100 RCF for 5 minutes
6. Add 500 &micro;L of Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol to the aqueous layer in the phase separating tube
7. Mix samples by inverting tubes and shaking for 1 minute. Do not mix so vigorously as to disrupt the silicone grease layer dividing the aqueous and organic layers
8. Centrifuge at 16,100 RCF for 5 minutes
9. Transfer 300 &micro;L of the top aqueous layer to a new 1.5 mL micro centrifuge tube. Avoid pipetting any of the silicon grease separating the phases

#### 4) Precipitation
1. Add 30 &micro;L of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 to isolation product that was transferred to new tube
2. Add 1 mL of 100% ethanol
3. Mix samples by inverting tubes and shaking for 1 minute
4. Centrifuge at 16,100 RCF for 30 minutes
5. Decant supernatant
6. Add 1 mL of 70% ethanol
7. Centrifuge at 16,100 RCF for 10 minutes
8. Decant supernatant
9. Air dry sample until most ethanol has evaporated but avoid allowing DNA pellet to dry completely
10. Suspend sample in 100 &micro;L TLE buffer solution
