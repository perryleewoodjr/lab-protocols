# Phenol Chloroform DNA Extraction Protocol
### Reagents
- Proteinase K 20mg/mL (CAS 39450-01-6)
- [Proteinase K Buffer Solution](https://phyletica.github.io/lab-protocols/pro-k.html)
- [TLE Buffer Solution](https://phyletica.github.io/lab-protocols/tle.html)


#### 1) Lysis
1. Prepare lysis master mix containing 5 &micro;L of 20 mg/mL proteinase K and 295 &micro;L proteinase K buffer solution per sample plus a little extra to account for pipetting error.
2. Add 300 &micro;L of lysis master mix to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing up to 20 mg of sample tissue (approximately the size of a grain of rice)
3. Incubate samples at 55 &deg;C in shaker incubator set to 500 for 4-6 hours or overnight.

#### 2) Isolation
Centrifuge sample
Add 300 uL of Bead Solution
Briefly vortex sample
Briefly centrifuge sample
Let sample sit at for 1 min
Place sample on magnet
Let sit on magnet for 5 min
Remove and dispose of solution without disturbing magnets
Add 1 mL of 70% ETOH
Let sit for 1 minute
Remove ethanol and dispose
Add 1 mL of 70% ETOH
Let sit for 1 minute
Remove ethanol and dispose
Briefly spin
Remove remainder of ethanol and dispose
Add 100 &micro;L of TLE buffer and briefly vortex
Briefly centrifuge to collect Solution
Let stand for 1 minute
Place on magnet stand for 5 minutes
Remove as much of solution as possible and put into new labelled tube.
