# SPRI Bead DNA Extraction Protocol
### Reagents
- Proteinase K 20mg/mL (CAS 39450-01-6)
- [Proteinase K Buffer Solution](https://phyletica.github.io/lab-protocols/pro-k.html)
- [TLE Buffer Solution](https://phyletica.github.io/lab-protocols/tle.html)
- [Speedbeads](https://baddna.uga.edu/Protocols/Speedbead_Protocol_June2016.docx)
- 70% ETOH

### Procedure
#### 1) Lysis
1. Prepare lysis master mix containing 5 &micro;L of 20 mg/mL proteinase K and 295 &micro;L proteinase K buffer solution per sample plus a little extra to account for pipetting error.
2. Add 300 &micro;L of lysis master mix to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing up to 20 mg of sample tissue (approximately the size of a grain of rice).
3. Incubate samples at 55 &deg;C in shaker incubator set to 500 for 4-6 hours or overnight.

#### 2) Isolation
1. Allow Speedbead solution to warm room temperature and mix by gently inverting the solution. Mix until beads are no longer sticking to the bottom of the tube. Before using beads, allow any bubbles that have been introduced by mixing to escape from the solution.
2. Add 300 uL of bead solution to tube containing lysis product.
3. Mix sample by flicking tube.
4. Briefly centrifuge to collect sample in bottom of tube.
5. Let sample sit for 5 minutes.
6. Place sample on magnet for 5 minutes or until all beads have collected on magnet and solution is clear.
7. Remove and dispose of solution without disturbing the beads on the magnet.
8. Add 1 mL of 70% ETOH.
9. Let sit for 1 minute.
10. Remove and dispose of ethanol without disturbing the beads on the magnet.
11. Add 1 mL of 70% ETOH.
12. Let sit for 1 minute.
13. Remove and dispose of ethanol without disturbing the beads on the magnet.
14. Briefly centrifuge sample to collect residual ethanol.
15. Remove and dispose of remaining ethanol without disturbing the beads on the magnet.
16. Add 100 &micro;L of TLE buffer and flick tube to mix beads into solution until they are no longer sticking to side of tube.
17. Briefly centrifuge to collect solution in bottom of tube.
18. Let stand for 1 minute.
19. Place on magnet stand for 5 minutes.
20. Remove as much of solution as possible without disturbing beads and put into new labelled tube.

#### Comments
Might want to start warming TLE buffer prior to elution to increase yields.
