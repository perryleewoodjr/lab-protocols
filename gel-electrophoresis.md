# Gel Electrophoresis Protocol

### Reagents
- [20X SB Buffer Solution](sb.md)
- Agarose (CAS 9012-36-6)
- 6X Gel Loading Dye
- 10,000X GelGreen&reg;
- 0.5 &micro;g/&micro;L DNA Ladder
- [TLE Buffer Solution](tle.md)

#### DNA Ladder Solution
Prepare DNA ladder working stock containing a 4:1:1 ratio of TLE buffer, gel loading dye, and DNA Ladder

#### 1X SB Buffer
Dilute 20X SB Buffer at a ratio of 1:19 20X SB buffer solution and deionized water

#### 1% Agarose Gel Casting
1. In a flask mix 1 gram agarose per 100 mL 1X SB Buffer.
2. Place solution into the microwave until it begins boiling and then immediately turn off the microwave. Avoid allowing the solution to boil over.
3. Remove from the microwave and swirl solution to mix thoroughly. If solution has many bubbles suspended in it place it back into the microwave very briefly until boiling again.
4. Add 0.5 &micro;L GelGreen&reg; per 100 mL and swirl solution in flask to mix.
5. Allow solution to cool to the point that you can hold your hand against the side for several seconds. This is to avoid warping the gel casting rig from high heat.
6. Pour solution into gel rig to a depth of 3-4 mm.
7. Put combs in place on the gel rig.
8. Allow gel to harden for at least 30 minutes.

#### Run DNA On Gel
1. Place gel into electrophoresis chamber.
2. Fill chamber with enough 1X SB buffer to cover the top of the gel.
3. Load samples and DNA Ladder Solution into gel. Samples should have at least 20 pg of DNA.
4. Add 0.1 &micro;g of ladder per mm of well width. Should be 1 &micro;L of ladder per 5mm of well width.
4. Run gel at ~16V per cm of gel length until dye has reached the edge of the gel
