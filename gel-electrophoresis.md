# Gel Electrophoresis Protocol

### Reagents
- [20X SB Buffer](sb.md)
- Agarose (CAS 9012-36-6)
- Loading Dye
- Gel Red
- DNA Ladder

#### 1) Prepare DNA Ladder Solution
A large volume of ladder solution can be prepared ahead of time so that this step is not always necessary
1. Prepare a solution of 1 part DNA ladder, 1 part loading dye, and 4 parts pure water.


#### 2) Prepare 1X SB Buffer
A large volume of 1X SB buffer can be prepared ahead of time so that this step is not always necessary.

1. Dilute 20X SB Buffer at a ratio of 1:19 SB buffer to deionized water


#### 3) Prepare 1% Agarose Gel
1. In a flask mix 1 part agarose by weight with 100 parts 1X SB Buffer by volume in mL. For example 1 gram of agarose would go into 100 mL 1X SB Buffer.
2. Place solution into the microwave until it begins boiling and then immediately turn off the microwave. Avoid allowing the solution to boil over.
3. Remove from the microwave and swirl solution to mix thoroughly. If solution has many bubbles suspended in it place it back into the microwave once more until boiling.
4. Add 1 &micro;L of gel red to solution and swirl to mix.
4. Allow solution to cool to the point that you can hold your gloved hand against the side of the flask for several seconds. You just want to avoid warping the gel casting rig from high heat.
5. Pour solution into gel rig to a depth of 3-4 mm.
6. Put combs in place on the gel rig.
7. Allow gel to harden for at least


#### 4) Run DNA On Gel
1. Place gel into electrophoresis chamber.
2. Fill chamber with enough 1X SB buffer to cover the top of the gel.
3. Load samples and DNA ladder into gel.
4. Run gel at 160V for ~45 minutes to ~1 hour and 30 minutes
5. Visualize or image the gel.
