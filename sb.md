# 20X Sodium Borate Buffer (SB Buffer)
### Reagents
- Sodium tetraborate decahydrate (CAS 1303-96-4)
	- 381.37 g/mol

### Concentrations
- 100 mM Sodium tetraborate decahydrate

### Procedure
Per liter
1. Dissolve 38.14 g Sodium tetraborate decahydrate in 800 mL of pure nuclease free water
2. Bring volume to 1 L with pure nuclease free water

### Comments
May want to confirm that this produces a 20X solution with a pH of 8.0 but probably isn't necessary
