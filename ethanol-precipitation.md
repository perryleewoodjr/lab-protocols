# Ethanol Precipitation Protocol

### Procedure
1. Add 1/10 volume of Sodium Acetate (3 M, pH 5.2).
2. Add 2.5-3.0X volume (calculated after addition of sodium acetate) of at least 95% ethanol.
3. Incubate at room temperature for at least 15 minutes.
4. Centrifuge at > 14,000 x g for 30 minutes.
5. Discard supernatant carefully, making sure the DNA pellet (which may not be visible) is not discarded
6. Wash with 70% ethanol.
7. Centrifuge again for 15 minutes.
8. Discard supernatant and dissolve pellet in TE. Make sure that the buffer comes in contact with the
whole surface of the tube since a significant portion of DNA may be deposited on the walls instead of in
the pellet.

### Final Concentrations
- 0.3 M Sodium acetate
- 70% ETOH


<!-- Comments: time and centrifuge speed are the biggest factors for DNA recovery. Don't worry so much about temperature despite what many protocols recommend. -->
